PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and 
manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce 
products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our environmental 
impact.
In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital 
technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made 
up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with 
us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements 
and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. E mployee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing 
contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.
As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and 
experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications. Using market 
intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to 
respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, React and 
Forward technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.
