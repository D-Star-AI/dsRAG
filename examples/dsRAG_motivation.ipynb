    "#### How to interpret the chunk relevance plot above\n",
    "In the plot above, the x-axis represents the chunk index. The first chunk in the document has index 0, the next chunk has index 1, etc. The y-axis represents the relevance of each chunk to the query. Viewing it this way lets us see how relevant chunks tend to be clustered in one or more sections of a document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the relevance values in this plot are actually a combination of the raw relevance value and the relevance ranks. An exponential decay function is applied to the ranks, and that is then multiplied by the raw relevance value. Using this combination provides a more robust measure of relevance than using just one or the other, at least in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What can we do with these clusters of relevant chunks?\n",
    "The core idea is that clusters of relevant chunks, in their original contiguous form, provide much better context to the LLM than individual chunks can. Now for the hard part: how do we actually identify these clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can calculate chunk values in such a way that the value of a segment is just the sum of the values of its constituent chunks, then finding the optimal segment is a version of the maximum subarray problem, for which a solution can be found relatively easily. How do we define chunk values in such a way? We'll start with the idea that highly relevant chunks are good, and irrelevant chunks are bad. We already have a good measure of chunk relevance, on a scale of 0-1, so all we need to do is subtract a constant threshold value from it. This will turn the chunk value of irrelevant chunks to a negative number, while keeping the values of relevant chunks positive. We call this the `irrelevant_chunk_penalty`. A value around 0.2 seems to work well empirically.\n",
