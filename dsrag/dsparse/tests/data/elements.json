On the\nother, anchoring ownership in the BU incentivizes local\noptimization, aiming to capture value in each and every\nfacility, with the potential to move more quickly and\nunlock significant growth.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen an increasing\nnumber of companies begin to revisit this choice\nand we expect this to be a growing theme through\n2024. To contribute to this debate, we reviewed\nover 20 years of McKinsey proprietary performance\ndatasets to draw insights linking asset performance\nwith operating model choices. We found, on average,\nthat BU or asset-centric models have the edge in\nterms of operational performance, but that they can\ncompromise on consistency and produce a wider\nrange of outcomes on both operating cost and\nproduction efficiency.\n\nIrrespective of the choice made, companies can also\ngo back to basics by focusing on some fundamental\nstep changes across their operating model: radical\nsimplification, value-backed technology deployment,",
